/**
 Creates a data task using the `sessionManager` instance for the specified URL request.

 If the same data task is already in the queue or currently being downloaded, the success and failure blocks are
 appended to the already existing task. Once the task completes, all success or failure blocks attached to the
 task are executed in the order they were added.

 @param url The URL request.
 @param completion A block to be executed when the image data task finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the image created from the response data of request. If the image was returned from cache, the response parameter will be `nil`.
